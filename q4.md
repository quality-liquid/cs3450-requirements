# Difference between function and non-functional requirements

The main difference between **functional requirements** and **non-functional requirements** lies in what each defines for a system: functional requirements specify what the system should do, while non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform its tasks.[^1][^3][^4]

## Definition

- **Functional requirements** define the specific behaviors, features, and operations a system must perform. They answer the question: "What must the system do?" Examples include user login, data processing, and payment transactions.[^3][^4][^1]
- **Non-functional requirements** describe the quality attributes, constraints, and performance metrics of the system—essentially, "How well must the system do it?" Examples include speed (response time), scalability, security, portability, and usability.[^4][^1][^3]


## Purpose

- **Functional requirements** ensure the system fulfills desired functions and business needs—features users request directly.[^1][^4]
- **Non-functional requirements** ensure the system meets expectations regarding performance, safety, reliability, and other attributes that shape user experience.[^4][^1]


## Measurement

- **Functional requirements** can be measured directly by checking if the system’s outputs and behaviors match specifications.[^5][^1]
- **Non-functional requirements** are often harder to quantify and are validated using benchmarks, metrics, or service-level agreements (SLAs).[^5][^1]


## Examples Table

| Type | Examples | How Verified |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Functional Requirements | Login, user registration, data entry, report generation [^1] | Functional tests, use cases |
| Non-functional Requirements | Response time < 3 seconds, system uptime 99.9%, PCI compliance [^3][^5] | Performance/security tests |

## Impact on Development

- **Functional requirements** drive the design and building of core system features.[^1]
- **Non-functional requirements** influence architectural decisions, performance optimization, and system quality.[^4][^1]

In summary, **functional requirements** describe what a system must do, while **non-functional requirements** define the quality standards for how those functions should be executed.[^3][^1][^4]
