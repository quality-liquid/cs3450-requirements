# What is the role of prototyping in software requirements gathering?

Prototyping plays a **crucial role** in software requirements gathering by providing a tangible, interactive model that assists stakeholders in clarifying, refining, and validating requirements before full-scale development begins. This approach helps avoid misunderstandings, encourages user feedback, and minimizes costly rework later in the project.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

## Key Functions of Prototyping in Requirements Gathering

- **Clarifying Requirements:** Prototypes offer visual and functional cues, allowing stakeholders to interact with the product early and recognize missing, unnecessary, or confusing elements in the requirements.[^2][^1]
- **Facilitating User Feedback:** By enabling users and stakeholders to engage with a working model, prototyping supports iterative feedback, which leads to more precise and user-driven requirement definitions.[^5][^3]
- **Reducing Risks:** Early experimentation and feedback help identify design flaws and usability concerns before committing significant resources, mitigating project and design risks.[^3][^6]


## Advantages of Prototyping

- **More Accurate Requirements:** Stakeholders see and interact with an application ahead of time, resulting in deeper understanding and improved requirement accuracy.[^4][^2]
- **Efficient Collaboration:** Prototypes provide a common reference for cross-team and stakeholder discussions, streamlining communication and teamwork.[^2]
- **Supports Flexibility:** Requirements can be refined or new ideas incorporated easily through multiple prototype iterations, ensuring the final product aligns with real needs.[^1][^4]


## Potential Drawbacks

- **Cost and Effort:** Prototyping requires time and resources, which may increase upfront costs.[^4]
- **Scope Creep:** Stakeholders may continually request changes or new features after seeing early prototypes, leading to variation in requirements.[^4]

Prototyping ensures requirements are **well-defined** and stakeholder-supported, greatly enhancing project outcomes and user satisfaction by making changes early, promoting collaboration, and enabling iterative refinement before full-scale development starts.[^3][^1][^2]
