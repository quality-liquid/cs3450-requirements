# How do you manage conflicting requirements among stakeholders?

To manage conflicting requirements among stakeholders, use a structured approach that balances open communication, analysis, and negotiation for win-win solutions.[^1][^3][^4]

## Key Steps for Managing Conflicts

### Clarify Roles \& Responsibilities

- Define the decision-making authority and responsibility of each stakeholder, especially the product owner or project manager.[^1]
- Ensure all stakeholders understand who sets priorities, and what their role is in the process.[^1]


### Actively Listen and Gather Information

- Hold open, constructive discussions to understand why requirements conflict.[^3][^5]
- Listen actively and empathetically, verifying and paraphrasing concerns for clarity.[^3]


### Analyze and Prioritize Issues

- Perform stakeholder analysis to uncover underlying motivations and priorities.[^2][^3]
- Use objective data and the organization’s overall mission to guide priority setting.[^2]
- Focus analysis on the core of the conflict, not just symptoms.[^3]


### Co-Create and Evaluate Compromises

- Bring stakeholders together to brainstorm, evaluate, and negotiate solutions.[^6][^3]
- Use structured tools (e.g., decision matrices, SWOT analysis) and mediation techniques for evaluating options.[^3]
- Document agreements and expected outcomes clearly.[^5]


### Communicate Decisions \& Monitor Outcomes

- Practice transparency to explain how and why certain requirements are prioritized or resolved.[^5][^2]
- Implement solutions with clear follow-up, tracking the impact, and monitoring for any unresolved issues.[^3]


## Useful Practices

- Use stakeholder management software to centralize requirements, map relationships, and track conflict resolution.[^3]
- When low trust exists, rely on agreed processes, documentation, and contract terms to guide resolution.[^5]
- Involve governance or higher authority if stakeholders are unable to agree.[^6]

This iterative, transparent approach builds trust and typically resolves conflicts effectively, ensuring stakeholder satisfaction and project success.[^4][^1][^3]
