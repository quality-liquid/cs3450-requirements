# Derived requirements versus primary requirements?

Derived requirements are **requirements that emerge during analysis or design** to support or enable the fulfillment of higher-level or stakeholder requirements, while primary (often called stakeholder or high-level) requirements are those **directly stated or provided by customers, users, or key stakeholders**.[^2][^3][^4]

## Primary Requirements

- These are **explicitly given** by stakeholders, users, or customers.[^4][^2]
- They define the fundamental needs the system must meet, such as business objectives, user goals, or contractual obligations.[^4]
- Primary requirements are the foundation for the system’s purpose and are typically expressed in the original requirements documentation.[^4]


## Derived Requirements

- Derived requirements are **not explicitly stated** in the original set of stakeholder requirements but arise due to design decisions, constraints, or system architecture.[^3][^2][^4]
- They are needed to ensure the primary requirements can be met, often surfacing during system analysis, synthesis, or after considering implementation details like performance, safety, or compatibility.[^3][^4]
- These supplement, but do not replace, primary requirements, providing important *internal* needs such as minimum storage, safety margins, or interface behaviors.[^2][^4]


## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Primary Requirements | Derived Requirements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Origin | Explicit, from stakeholders [^4] | Implicit, from analysis/design [^3][^4] |
| Purpose | State core system objectives [^4] | Enable fulfillment of primary reqs [^3] |
| Timing | Gathered early [^4] | Identified during design/analysis [^2] |
| Example | “System must allow X” [^4] | “System needs Y storage for X” [^4] |

## Key Points

- **Primary requirements** are the starting point for system definition and drive all subsequent development.[^4]
- **Derived requirements** arise only after deeper system understanding or design iteration; they ensure practical, complete, and robust solutions.[^3][^4]
- Both must be managed, traced, and validated to ensure the system meets user needs and is built correctly.[^3][^4]

In summary, primary requirements come directly from stakeholders, while derived requirements are discovered as necessary for implementation and completeness as the system design evolves.[^2][^3][^4]
