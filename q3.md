# What is the "MoSCoW" method for prioritizing requirements?

The **MoSCoW method** is a widely used technique for prioritizing requirements in software engineering and project management. The acronym "MoSCoW" stands for four categories:[2][4][8]

- **Must have:** Essential requirements without which the project or system will fail or be unusable. These are non-negotiable and must be delivered for the release to be considered successful.[4][6][8]
- **Should have:** Important but not critical. These add significant value, but the system can still operate without them in the short term if necessary.[6][8]
- **Could have:** Desirable but optional features. Including them enhances the system, but their absence doesn't impact core functionality.[8][6]
- **Won't have (this time):** Requirements that are agreed not to be included in the current release but could be revisited in the future. This helps set clear boundaries and manage expectations.[4][6][8]

## Purpose and Benefit

The MoSCoW method helps teams and stakeholders clarify priorities, ensuring that crucial requirements are addressed first and that project scope is well-managed. It's particularly useful in Agile environments where time and resources are limited, providing a structured way to handle shifting priorities and avoid scope creep.[5][6][8]

## How It Works

Requirements are categorized collaboratively by the project team and stakeholders, with the goal of focusing effort and resources on "Must have" items while keeping track of less critical features for possible future work. This process promotes transparency and consensus about what will be delivered.[6][8]

In summary, the MoSCoW method offers a simple, effective way to prioritize requirements, making it easier to manage time, resources, and stakeholder expectations in software development projects.[2][8][4]
