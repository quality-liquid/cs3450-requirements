# What is the difference between requirements elicitation and requirements analysis?

The primary difference between **requirements elicitation** and **requirements analysis** is that elicitation focuses on collecting and discovering requirements from stakeholders, while analysis involves examining, clarifying, refining, and validating those requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and actionable for development.[^1][^2][^4]

## Requirements Elicitation

Requirements elicitation is the structured process of drawing out requirements from stakeholders such as users, clients, and subject matter experts. It involves identifying what stakeholders need or expect from a system, often using techniques like interviews, surveys, workshops, observation, and prototyping to uncover explicit and implicit requirements. The goal is to generate a clear and comprehensive list of stakeholder needs upon which the rest of the project can be built.[^2][^4]

## Requirements Analysis

Requirements analysis, on the other hand, takes the initial set of requirements (often derived through elicitation) and examines them in detail. This phase involves clarifying, prioritizing, reconciling inconsistencies, resolving conflicts, and verifying the completeness and feasibility of the requirements. The aim is to ensure that every requirement is unambiguous, testable, measurable, and traceable before design and implementation begin.[^3][^5][^7][^1]

## Key Differences Table

| Aspect | Elicitation | Analysis |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Main Focus | Collecting requirements from stakeholders [^2] | Examining, refining, and validating requirements [^1] |
| Methods | Interviews, workshops, surveys, observation [^4] | Modeling, reviewing, prioritizing, resolving conflicts [^1][^3] |
| Output | Initial, often broad, requirements list [^4] | Clear, detailed, actionable requirements [^1][^5] |
| Timing in Lifecycle | Early (before or at project start) [^4] | After elicitation, before design [^5] |

In summary, **elicitation** gets the *raw material* (stakeholder needs), while **analysis** shapes that material into a solid foundation for development.[^4][^5][^1]
