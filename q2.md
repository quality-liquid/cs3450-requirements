# What makes some requirements good and others bad?

A **good requirement** is unambiguous, complete, consistent, feasible, testable, and clearly relevant to the goals of the system, while a **bad requirement** is vague, incomplete, contradictory, untestable, or not aligned with user or business needs. Good requirements make development smooth and predictable, whereas bad requirements often lead to miscommunication, wasted effort, and software that fails to solve the intended problem.[1][2][3][4]

## Characteristics of Good Requirements

- **Clear and Unambiguous:** The meaning is obvious to all stakeholders and cannot be misunderstood. Example: “The system shall allow users to reset their password via email.”[5][6][1]
- **Complete:** Contains all required information needed to implement and test the feature, leaving no open questions or gaps.[2][1][5]
- **Consistent:** Does not conflict with any other requirements; terminology and logic are used uniformly throughout.[1][2]
- **Testable/Verifiable:** The requirement can be checked by inspection, demonstration, test, or analysis.[6][5]
- **Feasible:** Can be implemented within technical and budgetary constraints.[2][5]
- **Atomic:** Describes a single feature or function, not several in one statement.[5][6]
- **Traceable:** Each requirement can be traced back to its origin and tracked through design, implementation, and testing.[1][2][5]

## Common Problems with Bad Requirements

- **Vague or Ambiguous:** Uses unclear terms like “user-friendly” or “fast,” which can be interpreted in different ways by different people.[3][5]
- **Incomplete:** Leaves out important details, leading to confusion or assumptions.[3][2]
- **Inconsistent:** Contradicts other requirements or uses terminology and logic inconsistently.[2][1]
- **Untestable:** Cannot be validated or measured, such as “the system should be intuitive”.[5][3]
- **Too Technical or Solution-Oriented:** Focuses on how to build the system instead of what is needed.[3]
- **Unstructured or Not Atomic:** Combines multiple requirements in one statement, making them hard to implement or test.[6][3]

## Impact of Good vs. Bad Requirements

Well-written requirements enhance communication, reduce misunderstandings, and help teams deliver projects on time and within budget. Poor requirements frequently cause project delays, cost overruns, and products that do not meet user or business needs.[4][1][3]
