# In the context of Software Engineering, what are requirements?

In software engineering, **requirements** are the documented conditions or capabilities that a software system must possess to satisfy user needs, solve a problem, or achieve an objective. They define what the system should do (features and behaviors) and the constraints under which it should operate, serving as the foundation for the entire development process.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

## Types of Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:** Specify what the software must do, often in the form of features or tasks the system should perform. Examples include user authentication, data processing, or report generation.[7][6][1]
- **Non-functional Requirements:** Describe how the system performs its functions, focusing on quality attributes such as performance, security, usability, and reliability.[6][1]
- **Domain Requirements:** Address conditions and standards specific to the application area or industry, like compliance with particular regulations (e.g., healthcare or finance).[1]

## Why Requirements Matter

- They ensure everyone involved has a clear, shared understanding of what the software should achieve, minimizing misunderstandings during development.[3][5][8]
- Well-defined requirements act as a **blueprint** for design, implementation, and testing, establishing the project's scope and success criteria from the outset.[4][9]
- Requirements play a crucial role in communication between stakeholders (users, developers, managers), helping align the system with user needs and business goals.[5][8]

## Requirements Process

- The activities around requirements include gathering (elicitation), analyzing, documenting (specification), validating, and managing them throughout the development life cycle.[2][7]
- Requirements should focus on **what** needs to be accomplished, not **how** the solution will be built, to avoid prematurely locking into a specific implementation.[6]

In summary, software engineering requirements define the "what" and "why" of a system so that developers, stakeholders, and users all share a clear understanding of the software's purpose and operational expectations.[2][3][6]
