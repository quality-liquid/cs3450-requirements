# What sections does a req. Spec. document include?

A requirements specification (req. spec.) document typically includes several major sections to comprehensively define the system, its objectives, and its requirements.[^1][^4][^5]

## Common Sections in a Req. Spec. Document

- **Introduction**: States the purpose, audience, scope, project objectives, and any relevant definitions or acronyms.[^4][^5][^6][^1]
- **Overall Description**: Provides context, including user needs, system context, assumptions, dependencies, and a high-level overview of the system's operation and stakeholders.[^5][^6][^1][^4]
- **Functional Requirements**: Lists specific behaviors or functions the system must perform, often using use cases, user stories, or detailed numbered requirements.[^9][^1][^4][^5]
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Describes qualities such as performance, reliability, usability, compliance, scalability, security, and other constraints.[^1][^4][^5][^9]
- **External Interface Requirements**: Specifies how the system interacts with other hardware, software, or users, detailing APIs, UI, communication protocols, and integration points.[^4][^9][^1]
- **System Architecture/Design Constraints**: High-level system architecture diagrams and any constraints on design or technology choices.[^5][^9]
- **Data Requirements**: Details data models, schemas, storage, and processing methods.[^9][^5]
- **User Requirements**: Defines expected user roles, permissions, and workflow scenarios.[^6][^5]
- **Assumptions and Dependencies**: Lists any system or project assumptions and dependencies on external factors.[^1][^5]
- **Project Constraints**: Time, budget, tools, and other limiting factors.[^4][^5]
- **Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Requirements**: Any industry-specific, legal, or regulatory requirements to be met.[^5][^1]
- **Appendices**: Supplemental information such as glossaries, detailed use cases, diagrams, and lists of TBD (to be determined) items.[^6][^1][^5]


## Example Structure

Below is an illustrative structure found in many industry-standard requirements specification documents:[^1][^4][^5]

- Introduction
- Overall Description
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- External Interface Requirements
- System Features (if needed)
- Data Requirements
- Integration Requirements
- User Requirements
- Constraints and Assumptions
- Legal/Regulatory Requirements
- Appendices

Each req. spec. may vary depending on the project, but these sections cover the essentials for most software and system engineering endeavors.[^6][^4][^5][^1]
